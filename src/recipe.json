        "PREP POTATOES - Peel 3 pounds russet potatoes (about 6 medium). Slice lengthwise into 1-inch-thick planks. Lay flat and slice again into 1-inch-thick strips. Stack strips together and cut crosswise into even cubes.",
        "COOK & SEASON - In a large pot, cover potatoes with at least 2 inches of water and season generously with kosher salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-high and continue boiling until potatoes are tender and easily pierced with the tip of a knife, 8 to 9 minutes. Drain and transfer to a bowl. Toss with 2 tablespoons vinegar; season with salt and freshly ground pepper. Let cool completely, about 30 minutes.",
        "DRESS TO IMPRESS - Meanwhile, whisk together 3/4 cup mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons mustard, and 1 tablespoon vinegar. Stir in 1 cup finely chopped celery (from 3 stalks); 1/2 cup sliced cornichons (from about 20); and 1/3 cup finely chopped scallions (from 3). Gently fold mayonnaise mixture into cooked potatoes; season with salt and pepper. Serve, or refrigerate in an airtight container up to 1 day (bring to room temperature before serving, about 30 minutes)."
